# Order Management System - Complete! üéâ

## What Was Built

I've implemented a complete order management system for your Unwind Designs store:

### 1. ‚úÖ Database Integration (Supabase)
- **Orders table** now has `stripe_session_id` column for tracking
- **Automatic order creation** when payments succeed
- **Full order history** stored in your database
- **Address management** for shipping

### 2. ‚úÖ Stripe Webhook Handler
- **Location**: `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- **Listens for**: `checkout.session.completed` events
- **Actions**:
  - Saves order to Supabase database
  - Extracts cart items from session metadata
  - Records shipping address and method
  - Sends confirmation email
- **Includes retry logic** and error handling

### 3. ‚úÖ Email Confirmations (Resend)
- **Location**: `src/lib/email.ts`
- **Beautiful HTML email template** with:
  - Order number and summary
  - Item breakdown with quantities
  - Shipping address
  - Total cost breakdown
  - Branded design
- **Automatic sending** after successful payment

### 4. ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard
- **Location**: `/admin/orders`
- **Features**:
  - View all orders in real-time
  - See customer details and shipping addresses
  - Update order status (pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered)
  - Link directly to Stripe dashboard for payment details
  - Filter by order status
  
### 5. ‚úÖ Order Services (Updated)
- **Location**: `src/lib/orders.ts`
- **Now uses Supabase** instead of in-memory storage
- **Methods**:
  - `createOrder()` - Save orders to database
  - `getAllOrders()` - Fetch all orders
  - `getOrderById()` - Get specific order
  - `getOrderBySessionId()` - Find order from Stripe session
  - `updateOrderStatus()` - Change order status
  - `getOrdersByStatus()` - Filter orders

## Setup Required

### 1. **Resend Account** (Email Service)

**Option A: Sign up for Resend (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://resend.com/signup
2. Create a free account (100 emails/day, 3,000/month)
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=orders@unwinddesigns.com.au
   ```

**Option B: Skip emails for now**
- The system works without Resend
- Orders are still saved, just no emails sent
- You'll see a warning in logs but everything else works

### 2. **Supabase Service Role Key**

Add this to your `.env.local` (you should already have this):
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

Get it from: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí `service_role` key

### 3. **Stripe Webhook** (Production Only)

For development, webhooks work locally. For production:

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "+ Add endpoint"
3. Enter: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the **Signing secret** and add to production `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

## How It Works

### Order Flow:

1. **Customer completes checkout** on your site
2. **Stripe processes payment**
3. **Stripe sends webhook** to `/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. **Your webhook**:
   - Creates order in Supabase
   - Saves all order details
   - Sends confirmation email via Resend
5. **Customer receives** confirmation email
6. **You see order** in `/admin/orders` dashboard

### Success Page:

- Now shows **full order details** from database
- Uses the Stripe session ID to lookup the order
- Displays order number, items, shipping address

---

## Testing the System

### 1. **Test a Purchase**:
```bash
# Server should already be running
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/shop
```

1. Add "Wander Troopy Flat Pack" to cart
2. Go to cart ‚Üí Calculate shipping
3. Select a shipping option
4. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
5. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Fill in shipping address
7. Complete payment

### 2. **Check the Results**:

**Terminal logs** should show:
```
üì¶ Order created from checkout session: [order-id]
‚úÖ Confirmation email sent to: [customer-email]
```

**Check order in database**:
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `orders`
- You should see your new order!

**Check admin dashboard**:
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/orders`
- You should see your order listed

**Check email**:
- If Resend is set up, check the customer email
- If not set up, you'll see a warning but order still saved
