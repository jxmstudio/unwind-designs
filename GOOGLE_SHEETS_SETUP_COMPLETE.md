## üîí **Security & Permissions**

### Service Account Access
Your service account `unwind-sheets@unwinddesigns.iam.gserviceaccount.com` needs these permissions:

1. **Google Sheets API** must be enabled in your Google Cloud project
2. The service account must have **Editor** access to your spreadsheet:
   - Open your spreadsheet
   - Click "Share"
   - Add `unwind-sheets@unwinddesigns.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Give it "Editor" permission

### API Quotas
- Google Sheets API has generous free quotas
- Default: 500 requests per 100 seconds per user
- Default: 100 requests per 100 seconds per project
- More than enough for form submissions!

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### Form Submits But No Google Sheets Row

**Check:**
1. Service account has Editor access to the sheet
2. Google Sheets API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs`
4. Look for errors mentioning "Google Sheets"

### Row Added But Missing Data

**This is normal for Contact Form:**
- Contact form only fills: Date, Source, Name, Email, Message
- Build wizard fills ALL columns

### Email Works But Sheets Doesn't

**Possible causes:**
1. Service account doesn't have access (share the sheet!)
2. Google Sheets API not enabled
3. Wrong spreadsheet ID

---

## üìß **Email Notifications**

Both forms also send emails to **Info@unwinddesigns.com.au** via Resend API.

**Email includes:**
- Contact Form: Name, Email, Message
- Build Wizard: Complete project details, budget, timeline, everything

You get BOTH email notifications AND Google Sheets records for every submission!

---

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### 1. Filter By Source
Use Google Sheets filter to show:
- Only contact forms: `Source = "contact-form"`
- Only build requests: `Source = "build-wizard"`

### 2. Add Conditional Formatting
- Highlight new submissions (today's date)
- Color-code by project type or budget
- Flag "Marketing Consent = Yes" for follow-up

### 3. Create Pivot Tables
- Track submissions over time
- See most popular base kits
- Analyze budget ranges

### 4. Set Up Email Notifications
In Google Sheets:
1. Tools ‚Üí Notification rules
2. Get emailed when new rows are added
3. Real-time notifications of new submissions!

### 5. Connect to Other Tools
- Export to CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Automate follow-ups with Zapier
- Create reports with Google Data Studio

---

## üéØ **Next Steps (Optional)**

### Add Slack Notifications
Want instant Slack notifications for new builds?

1. Create a Slack incoming webhook
2. Add to Vercel: `vercel env add SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL production`
3. Redeploy

### Add More Sheets
You can create separate sheets for:
- `Sheet1` - All submissions (current)
- `ContactForms` - Only contact forms
- `BuildRequests` - Only build wizard
- `Archive` - Older submissions

Update the `RANGE` variable in `src/lib/google-sheets.ts` to target different sheets.
